=head1 NAME

HTML::Lint::Error - Error object for the Lint functionality

=head1 SYNOPSIS

See L<HTML::Lint> for all the gory details.

=head1 EXPORTS

None.  It's all object-based.

=head1 METHODS

Almost everything is an accessor.

=head1 Error types: C<STRUCTURE>, C<HELPER>, C<FLUFF>

Each error has a type.  Note that these roughly, but not exactly, go
from most severe to least severe.

=over 4

=item * C<STRUCTURE>

For problems that relate to the structural validity of the code.
Examples: Unclosed <TABLE> tags, incorrect values for attributes, and
repeated attributes.

=item * C<HELPER>

Helpers are notes that will help you with your HTML, or that will help
the browser render the code better or faster.  Example: Missing HEIGHT
and WIDTH attributes in an IMG tag.

=item * C<FLUFF>

Fluff is for items that don't hurt your page, but don't help it either.
This is usually something like an unknown attribute on a tag.

use constant CONFIG     => 1;
use constant STRUCTURE  => 2;
use constant HELPER     => 3;
use constant FLUFF      => 4;

=head2 new()

Create an object.  It's not very exciting.

=cut

sub new {
    my $class    = shift;

    my $file     = shift;
    my $line     = shift;
    my $column   = shift;
    my $errcode  = shift;
    my @errparms = @_;

    # Add an element that says what tag caused the error (B, TR, etc)
    # so that we can match 'em up down the road.
    my $self  = {
        _file    => $file,
        _line    => $line,
        _column  => $column,
        _errcode => $errcode,
        _errtext => undef,
        _type    => undef,
    };

    bless $self, $class;

    $self->_expand_error( $errcode, @errparms );

    return $self;
}

sub _expand_error {
    my $self = shift;

    my $errcode = shift;

    my $specs = $errors{$errcode};
    my $str;
    if ( $specs ) {
        ($str, $self->{_type}) = @{$specs};
    }
    else {
        $str = "Unknown code: $errcode";
    }

    while ( @_ ) {
        my $var = shift;
        my $val = shift;
        $str =~ s/\$\{$var\}/$val/g if defined $str;
    }

    $self->{_errtext} = $str;

    return;
}

=head2 is_type( $type1 [, $type2 ] )

Tells if any of I<$type1>, I<$type2>... match the error's type.
Returns the type that matched.

    if ( $err->is_type( HTML::Lint::Error::STRUCTURE ) ) {....

=cut

sub is_type {
    my $self = shift;

    for my $matcher ( @_ ) {
        return $matcher if $matcher eq $self->type;
    }

    return;
}

=head2 where()

Returns a formatted string that describes where in the file the
error has occurred.

For example,

    (14:23)

for line 14, column 23.

The terrible thing about this function is that it's both a plain
ol' formatting function as in

    my $str = where( 14, 23 );

AND it's an object method, as in:

    my $str = $error->where();

I don't know what I was thinking when I set it up this way, but
it's bad practice.

=cut

sub where {
    my $line;
    my $col;

    if ( not ref $_[0] ) {
        $line = shift;
        $col = shift;
    } else {
        my $self = shift;
        $line = $self->line;
        $col = $self->column;
    }
    $col ||= 0;
    return sprintf( '(%s:%s)', $line, $col + 1 );
}

=head2 as_string()

Returns a nicely-formatted string for printing out to stdout or some similar user thing.

=cut

sub as_string {
    my $self = shift;

    return sprintf( '%s %s %s', $self->file, $self->where, $self->errtext );
}

=head2 file()

Returns the filename of the error, as set by the caller.

=head2 line()

Returns the line number of the error.

=head2 column()

Returns the column number, starting from 0

=head2 errcode()

Returns the HTML::Lint error code.  Don't rely on this, because it will probably go away.

=head2 errtext()

Descriptive text of the error

=head2 type()

Type of the error

=cut

sub file        { my $self = shift; return $self->{_file}    || '' }
sub line        { my $self = shift; return $self->{_line}    || '' }
sub column      { my $self = shift; return $self->{_column}  || '' }
sub errcode     { my $self = shift; return $self->{_errcode} || '' }
sub errtext     { my $self = shift; return $self->{_errtext} || '' }
sub type        { my $self = shift; return $self->{_type}    || '' }


=head1 POSSIBLE ERRORS

Each possible error in HTML::Lint has a code.  These codes are used
to identify each error for when you need to turn off error checking
for a specific error.
