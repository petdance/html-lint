        Here's an icon of my girlfriend Jenny: &#8675309; <!-- invalid because we cap at 65536 -->
        <p>
        And here's an icon of a deceased cow: &#xdeadbeef; <!-- Invalid because we cap at xFFFF -->
        <p>
        Another deceased cow: &xdeadbeef; <!-- Not a valid hex entity, but unknown to our lookup tables -->
        <p>
        Here's an awesome link to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yLhA0ROGi4&amp;feature=related">"You Better Swim"</a> from the SpongeBob movie.
        <!--
        Here in the safety of comments, we can put whatever &invalid; and &malformed entities we want, &
        nobody can stop us.  Except maybe Cheech & Chong.
